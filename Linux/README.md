# 🐧 Linux Hardening

This section provides security hardening guidance for Linux systems. It covers a wide range of configurations to strengthen the operating system, minimize vulnerabilities, and maintain compliance.

## 🔐 Key Focus Areas

- File system permissions and ownership
- SSH hardening (disabling root login, key-based authentication)
- Firewall configuration (iptables, nftables, firewalld)
- Kernel hardening via sysctl parameters
- Service minimization and process isolation
- Intrusion detection systems (AIDE, OSSEC)
- Logging and monitoring configurations
- Secure cron jobs and scheduled tasks
- Disable unnecessary services and modules
- Compliance with CIS Benchmarks and OpenSCAP standards

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Test all configurations in non-production environments. Adjust hardening measures to fit operational and business needs.
