# 🌐 Network Hardening

This section focuses on securing network infrastructure, including routers, switches, firewalls, and other network devices. It contains guidelines to improve the resilience of networks against threats.

## 🔐 Key Focus Areas

- Disable insecure management protocols (Telnet, SNMP v1/v2)
- Enforce secure management protocols (SSH, HTTPS, SNMPv3)
- VLAN segmentation and network isolation
- Implementation of Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Firewall rule hardening
- Disable unused ports and services
- Secure remote access configurations (VPN, IPsec)
- Network traffic monitoring and logging
- Threat detection and mitigation
- Secure DNS, DHCP, and NTP configurations

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Always validate configurations in test environments. Network hardening must align with operational requirements and network design.
